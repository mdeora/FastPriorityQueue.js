# FastPriorityQueue.js : a fast heap-based priority queue in JavaScript
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lemire/FastPriorityQueue.js.png)](https://travis-ci.org/lemire/FastPriorityQueue.js)

A heap can be used to implement a priority queue. At all times, you can insert
elements quickly in a heap, and query the smallest element. You remove (poll)
the smallest element quickly as well.

FastPriorityQueue is an attempt to implement a performance-oriented priority queue
in JavaScript. It can be several times faster than other similar libraries.
It is ideal when performance matters.

Usage
===

```javascript
var x = new FastPriorityQueue();
x.add(1);
x.add(0);
x.add(5);
x.add(4);
x.add(3);
x.peek(); // should return 0, leaves x unchanged
x.size; // should return 5, leaves x unchanged
while(!x.isEmpty()) {
  console.log(x.poll());
} // will print 0 1 3 4 5
x.trim(); // (optional) optimizes memory usage
```

You can also provide the constructor with a comparator function.


```javascript
var x = new FastPriorityQueue(function(a,b) {return a > b});
x.add(1);
x.add(0);
x.add(5);
x.add(4);
x.add(3);
while(!x.isEmpty()) {
  console.log(x.poll());
} // will print 5 4 3 1 0 
```

If you are using node.js, you need to import the module:

```javascript
var FastPriorityQueue = require("fastpriorityqueue");
var b = new FastPriorityQueue();// initially empty
b.add(1);// add the value "1"
```
npm install
===

      $ npm install fastpriorityqueue

Computational complexity
===

The function calls "add" and "poll" have logarithmic complexity with respect
to the size of the data structure (attribute size). Looking at the top value
is a constant time operation.



Testing
===

Using node.js (npm), you can test the code as follows...

      $ npm install mocha
      $ npm test

Is it faster?
===

It tends to fare well against the competition.
In some tests, it can be five times faster than any other 
JavaScript implementation we could find.

Fastest is FastPriorityQueue
```

Note that ``qheap`` has been updated following the introduction of ``FastPriorityQueue``, with a reference to ``FastPriorityQueue`` which might explains the fact that its performance is comparable to ``FastPriorityQueue``.

Insertion order
===

A binary heap does not keep track of the insertion order.
